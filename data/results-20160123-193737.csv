First, this is flat-out untrue (Hillary was against DADT in her 2000 Senate campaign), and second, it's a gross misrepresentation of the situation when DADT was instituted. Bill Clinton originally campaigned on allowing gays to serve openly in the military, a policy Hillary also supported. This wasn't politically viable at the time, as Congress wanted to continue the current policy of a 100% ban on gays serving in the military. Bill instituted DADT as a compromise and it was a step in the right direction at the time; unfortunately, backlash to the policy from conservatives (both in Congress and in the military) limited its effectiveness as the ""Don't Pursue"" element of DADT wasn't really adhered to as closely as it should have been -- which is why Hillary came out against the policy as having failed in 1999.

Right now we don't have any sort of moratorium going on and that hasn't kept us from building essentially no nuclear power plants. Investing in nuclear power isn't smart from a profit standpoint.

The initial investment is way too high and it takes too long to see kickbacks even though nuclear plants probably have the highest ROI.

This is what makes Trump so dangerous in the general election. He can go to Hillary's left and say he wants a $20 minimum wage and free healthcare for everyone paid for by higher taxes on millionaires and billionaires and not lose one supporter that he has today, while picking up some of gullible folks on the left who might believe that he actually intends to do what he says. 

No matter what Hillary says she'll do for the working and middle class, Trump can just say he'll do ten times as much, no matter how impossible. Hillary says she wants $15, so Trump will say he wants $20. Then what can Hillary do? Say she wants $25? Then Trump will say $30.

"Arrested at a Klan riot. I'm sure that happens all the time. Later, sued along with his son for housing discrimination for one of the largest settlements in history. Later, his son runs for President with incendiary racist statements. His son also gets the endorsement of the Klan and white supremacist groups, who call him (their word) their 'savior'. Seems to me that the Trumps can't escape the shadow of racism.

Whether Fred Trump was convicted or not, his presence and arrest at a Klan rally, where presumably the participants are easily identified by their robes, is proof enough for me. No normal person would hang around at a Klan rally, certainly not after a riot jumps off. It wasn't simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Edit: Here is further evidence that police could identify who participated, though maybe not whom assaulted the police officers.

"&gt; You keep using that word but I don't think it means what you think it means.
&gt; Seriously, which part of that claim is a strawman? Are you saying Republicans don't consistently brag about how great they are at creating jobs and growing the economy? Seriously?
&gt; It's really annoying how you keep making these inane claims without ever really elaborating why I'm wrong with such criticisms.

The strawman you're creating is the one where Republicans are saying that lowering tax rates will invariably lead to increased job growth despite anything else going on in the economy, because that's all you've offered an argument against. 

&gt;Uh...don't Republicans normally support raising interest rates? Don't they claim that doing so will promote job growth? And what about the might of the Bush tax cuts and his deregulation policies?

In recent history they've supported raising the interest rates as opposed to keeping interest rates artificially low. The reason for this is because it ""stimulates"" the economy now, but hurts it in the long run. So just because Republicans supported raising interest rates doesn't mean raising interest rates are going to lead to gains right now. It's  the responsible thing to do, rather than the thing that is going to score points for ""their side.""

&gt;Never said Bush caused the first one. The second one however is pretty easy, he never bothered to regulate the banks who re-packed and sold toxic mortgages. This was the free market at work, baby.

lol wait huh? How is it the free market at work when we bail out the banks? How is it the free market at work when we have loose money that creates demand for these financial products? How is it the free market when we have government policy that is ADVOCATING AND ENFORCING QUOTAS FOR SUB PRIME LOANS? How is it the free market when we have regulations like market to market accounting?

And don't you think it's a little goddamn ridiculous to put the blame on Bush for the financial crisis for NOT doing something? None of the previous Democratic presidents did whatever it would've taken to stop that from happening, so why is it only the fault of the president at the time it happened? OH RIGHT! Because you're an ideological simpleton.

&gt;What the hell are you talking about? I admitted both Reagan and Obama had low interest rates on their watch? Being dishonest would be if I claimed Obama DIDN'T and Reagan DID, to make him look bad. Jeez.

No it's dishonest because you only mentioned it for Reagan and then only admitted it helped Obama when I brought it up.

&gt;Oh you are so adorable. We've had about 13 million private sector jobs created since the recession bottomed out. That's 5 million more than Bush had in his entire 8 years of positive job growth (again, ignoring the job losses on his watch).
So you're telling me with a straight face that ""OF COURSE we'd have MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of more jobs created under Obama than Bush did, even with all his job killing spending, taxing, and regulation policies!""?

Yeah as usual it's like you don't even read what I write. I just told you that this is what economies do after recessions, they rebound. Looking at Obama's job growth from the bottom of the biggest recession in history as he is tripling the money supply and keeping interest rates low is HARDLY a reasonable number to look at. But again, this is all you know how to do. Just this surface-level /r/politics partisan bullshit.

&gt;Yeah, okay.

Wait I'm sorry what? Did you see the chart I just posted? You're not concerned about that? You don't think that calls into question Obama's numbers? Your response to this is ""yeah, okay""? What does that mean?

&gt;No, you goober. My argument is that doing things that Republicans are against, like raising taxes on the rich, or increasing regulations have a tiny, or negligible effect when it comes to growth and job creation. This has been proven time and time again.
You say that we'll never know for sure how things could have gone different under a different hypothetical policy. Fine. But if that's the case, then how the hell are you so damn sure that you're policies are universally better?

I don't even know wtf you mean by ""my policies."" And I assume when you say they have negligible effects on growth and job creation, you mean in the short term. It seems pretty obvious that Republican and SSE policies are more focused on the long term, whereas the left seems focused on stimulating at the economy right now to juke their stats and the future be damned because dumbasses like you will just take an average of the job growth when the president had a D in front of his name, and average job growth when the president had an R in front of his name and call it a day, because you're ignorant of the issues at actually matter.",,,,Holophonist,,,1449284379,t5_2cneq,t3_3tctto,t1_cxno6br,1,1451447769,0,0,cxnp38a,politics,1,,

"There are a thousand ways to stop them and play by the rules. Just make bigger boots on the ground commitment, or up air strikes, or assist rival groups and allies. All the things we've been doing since WWII. Victory is just a matter of persistence and scale of commitment.

There's no *point* to trying to defeat ISIS until there's a plan for the aftermath, and there's no plan that wouldn't be a massive commitment for years and years.

"&gt; Our rebellion in 1776 was unbelievable and far fetched? We were facing a foreign monarch (absolute power).

Yes. History is not a series of inevitable events. It was unbelievable because nobody believed that the colonial powers would be able to defeat the British Empire. Most people expected the British Empire to destroy the colonies and completely suppress the people, so they opposed the revolution until they were persuaded otherwise. 

Before the revolution, everyone considered themselves British citizens, so they didn't really perceive the monarch as a foreign power. Read the book 1776 to find out more about how impossible the revolution seemed and how miraculous it's success was.

What do you think people thought when they saw under-fed country-boys with their dad's rotten rifles taking on disciplined redcoats and ruthless Hessian mercenaries?

They thought what you believed. That they were insane to think they could stand up to such strength or that they could make a difference. America exists today because of cannons and gunpowder. Writing the declaration was easy, making it real cost a lot of blood and I find it shameful that we would delude ourselves into thinking the 2nd amendment was trivial and could be renegotiated. It's a sad display of ignorance towards our own history.

&gt;I believe in separation of powers and voting more than I believe in gun ownership in terms of tyranny-deterrent.

I believe in both. However if I ever lose the former, we must make sure we can get it back with the latter.

"&gt;And yeah, you're asking for concrete numbers a few months before the first primary has even been done. Zero other candidates have that, why are you expecting it of Sanders? Because he's promising big plans? He's given rough outlines on all of it, says he wants to raise the top tax bracket to 'around 50%' and by and large has everything account for in broad strokes

Then admit that he isn't actually providing the information necessary to ""educate yourself"" about the actual mechanisms of his policies, or the numbers, or how he plans to deal with very important issues his policies raise.

But don't do the whole ""well actually he has all of his policies laid out if you just educate yourself"" thing if those policies are not so much laid out as broad stroked.

&gt;Everything he's proposing is paid for, and we know the basic mechanisms if not the exact numbers.

Well, no.  He claims everything he's proposing is paid for.  But no one can double-check or question his math or his analysis because he's released neither.

"She's not a Clinton. She married Clinton, before he was a political giant. It's not the same as Bush being born into a family of wealth and political standing. 

Hillary was in politics since she was a kid through her own doing, she was campaigning for *Goldwater and McCarthy*, most kids on reddit barely know who those people were. 

Hillary is definitely tied to Bill Clinton, but she's also her own person. Jeb Bush however was a Bush from day one and all of his political enterprises were aided by that fact. He's not a self-made man. He's a product of a dynasty.

"&gt; I disagree. While your grandmother may be able to watch the debate online on Youtube, there are many other people who are unable to use the computers even to this day.

I disagree.  While the number of old people who can't watch the debates online is non-zero, you haven't demonstrated that (1) this old-no-online demographic is big enough to matter or that (2) this demographic are the ones being negatively affected by the weekend scheduling of debates.  Historically low ratings on Friday/Saturday slots is attributed to the absence of young people, the very people least affected by the allegedly bad-scheduling because they have online access.    If young people are the ones hurt by the scheduling, yet they're the ones also least harmed by not watching it live (due to online access), then there's little reason to worry about the scheduling.

&gt; For young people, we should be encouraging more of them to follow the politics by watching them while they are live. It gives a sense of authenticity rather than watching clips that the media can edit. 

There's no more practical authenticity offered by watching something live unless you think the non-live version was doctored.  So until you can demonstrate this is something that's actually happening, you're basically just inflating the value of live-debates to combat a problem that doesn't actually exist.

&gt; Also, I think it would be better if they had shown the debate on a Tuesday, so it doesn't coincide with events like football.

People can watch it online after they watch the football game.

&gt; Also, the last part was me trying to say that we should encourage more people to be active in politics. 

Sure, we should encourage more active voters, but that has little to do with “*empathy*”.  And it's not like people are any less active in politics because they ended up watching it online.

&gt; The reason why we still have voter apathy is because of the methods the DNC has been using to discourage viewers from watching the debates and etc.

Except that we've had a voter apathy problem long before the 2016 primary debate schedule was announced.

For starters, the bare MINIMUM the republicans can get from the hispanic vote is 40%.

"Government research is more theoretical, and pharma companies turn it into something useful.

For example, I used to work in an organic chemistry lab. We were trying to find a way to join two molecules together to make an extremely potent anti-cancer reagent. Now, assuming we were successful, we would patent this and sell it to a pharma company. There's nothing else for us to do because if we were to try and turn this into an actual drug, disaster would ensue, since:

1. We would need to convince our biology department to test it on animals first. Good luck with that, because other PhD professors don't like being told what to do, since this is a university, and they have tenure

2. Phase I, II, and III clinical trials pretty much require a hospital and several physicians to run, hope your university has a medical school

3. If it fails, you just lost a lot of money, like A LOT of money. The chances of it failing are pretty good as well, definitely something that would force you to raise tuition

"There isn't a gun show loophole per se, but there's a way to use gun shows to organize unchecked sales.  

Federal law, applied in all 50 states, says anyone who buys guns with the intent to sell them must have a Federal Firearms License (FFL).  This includes every gun shop, physical or online.  In addition, FFL holders must run a National Instant Check System (NICS) background check on *every* buyer.  The only exception is buyers with a valid concealed carry license (because they've already been printed and checked), and even then, most FFL holders insist on running the NICS check just in case someone recently became a prohibited person by Form 4473 rules.  

The problem arises from the fact that private sales are not even *allowed* to use the NICS background checks, much less required to.  Some of the people at gun shows are not FFL holders because they either (1) don't buy guns with intent to sell and therefore don't need a license, or (2) are breaking federal law by engaging in unlicensed arms dealing.  These people will gladly sell their stock at a gun show, and no NICS checks are involved.  

So the ""gun show loophole"" is not a problem specifically with gun shows - they're just a convenient venue.  The real issue is people taking advantage of private sale laws and a high-access location to sell guns, compounded by the fact that private sellers cannot use the same background check system as FFL holders.  

In my opinion, the way to close the ""gun show loophole"" is to enact the following two changes: 

- Open the federal NICS to *all* sellers.  This will require some care so it isn't open to fraudulent use to gain personal information about people, but such a thing could be done.  With open access, private sellers can run checks on people and know they're not directly arming criminals.  

- Have the ATF and/or local law enforcement screen sellers at gun shows to make sure there aren't people who obviously intend to engage in arms dealing without an FFL.  A guy who shows up with 5 spare Mosins he doesn't want anymore is probably fine, but the guy who keeps coming back every year with 20 unfired ARs should probably get shut down.

"Since this is the first reasonable response in this thread, I'll put my opinion here.

Even the phrase ""mass shooting"" doesn't do any justice or have any accuracy as to what the *real* intent of the violence is.

In the case of instances such as Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and San Bernardino, there *is* an actual common thread that makes these different than your average street violence.

This is a premeditated, military-style action against soft targets with the intent to create fear. They are forms of domestic terrorism committed by individuals with sociopolitical motivation.

Calling them *mass shootings* lumps them into a much broader category that doesn't necessarily have the same ramifications as these specific instances. But being the mainstream media (and obliged to fulfill every ""good"" American's fear porn addiction) they refuse to boil down the motivations and instead use these ""facts"" to push *their* agenda (in and of itself a case of lost journalistic integrity). The agenda being that guns are bad mmm'kay.

Any premeditated attack on a soft target should be simply labeled domestic terrorism. And these attacks make up only a very small fraction of gun violence, in which use of a firearm on others still only makes up half of the actual use of firearms. To make this even more apparent as to how rare this type of domestic terrorism actually is, you can then remove gun deaths from lawful use of a firearm (ie self protection) and the violence between armed factions (gang violence) and you'll see that the cases of ""mass shootings"", better termed domestic terrorism, are *very* low.

"The last time California's districts were drawn by the legislature, it was done with the full cooperation of the Republicans, who put their own re-elections above all else.  Basically, the legislature created overwhelmingly safe seats, divided between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans clearly in the minority. Thus, California's top-two primary system and commission-drawn districts, by ballot initiative.


Most recently, when a commission drew the districts, the Democrats just plain outsmarted the Republicans in lobbying and politicking.  If I remember correctly, there were even news stories written about Republicans complaining that they didn't think the Democrats would do what they did, so the Republicans didn't do it, either.  The Republicans said the Democrats ""cheated,"" but I don't remember the specifics.  The impression I had was that the Republicans had, once again, demonstrated their complete and utter inability to be considered a real political party because of their incompetence.  Any party who doesn't plan for cheating by the other party, when the stakes are a 10-year redistricting plan, deserves 10 years out in the wilderness, until the next redistricting commission convenes.

"Full disclosure: im not american, but looking in from the outside here's what in opinion is the problem with the gun issue and why it doesn't go anywhere. 

1) You have people on the left who's hearts are in the right place when they want to ban ""assault weapons"" because of tragedies like mass shootings.

2) You have people on the right who will fight tooth and nail to have as many guns of whatever flavor as they can, one for every occasion, to an irrational extent.

3) You have people on both sides who like and use guns who know that the official number of guns is around 300 million. It's likely much much more. They understand that it's damn near impossible to actually do this, on top of getting the Supreme Court to pick a fight with the second amendment over a vague term like ""assault weapons"".

4) you have a US government that is corrupt by every sense of the word when it comes to violating rights, propaganda that steals your rights like ""patriot act"", ""freedom act"", ""Eagle caw liberty Act"" etc etc. And you have Edward Snowden who basically showed that things are hopelessly fucked and the constitution is largely being ignored by a National Security state who's main interest is economic espionage, smashing dissent, and controlling the populace while using the fear of terror to pass draconian legislation. 

5) you have a completely bought corporate/state controlled mainstream media where they are all in with the government on misinformation through statistics like 300+ ""mass shootings"" in order to push the gun control narrative. This passes off group 2, 3, and people who are informed about 4 because they see the current government is simply not trustworthy.


The fight lies in what people see motivations are. People who want some gun control because they want violence to stop, people who don't want to give an inch, people who want to give an inch but don't trust the motivations of the government and with very good reason. And why would you after all the blatant disregard for rights in past decade, and Snowden? 

My opinion as an outsider is be aware of motivations. Just because group 1 who's hearts are in the right place are asking for something and they are the majority, does not mean that the government supporting them is doing it for the same reasons. Remember the ""let's get rid of encryption because bad guys use encryption"" narrative that was tried? Remember that decade long war based on lies that got thousands of Americans killed, nearly a million Iraqis killed, used the excuse of terror to take away your rights and unleashed ISIS on the world from whatever cage under the earth they were locked in by leaving a void? I've had this discussion with friends here. We all are cool with the gun control in Europe and Canada. But we all agree that if we were American we would never trust the motivations of the US government so we see it as a very complex and nuanced issue.

And I'll just leave this here as well to see if any bells are rung. Inverted totalitarianism.

"In 2008 there were only 6 sanctioned debates, the same as 2016. The rest were not sanctioned debates. 

In 2016 the DNC and all candidates agree via written contract to participate only in sanctioned political debates. If any of the candidates were to break from this promise they risk not being allowed to participate in sanctioned debates.

Sanders agreed to this.

If Sanders had felt that this debate schedule was a vast left wing conspiracy to keep him from being elected then he was foolish to sign the agreement and instead should have refused only to challenge the other candidates to debates without DNC support.

"Here is something I haven't seen discussed on Reddit that much:

&gt; Two senior Democrats familiar with the program and the investigation told CNN that the Sanders campaign accessed turnout projections for Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, a key piece of strategy the Clinton campaign has been working on with modeling and analytics.

&gt; The Sanders team, which consisted of four people, ran multiple searches in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and about 10 March states, including Florida and Colorado. In Iowa and New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign has ranked voters on a scale of 1-100 for turnout, enthusiasm and support, the senior Democrats said. The Sanders campaign ran two searches: ""Show me all the Clinton people rated higher than 60"" and ""Show me all the people rated less than 30."" This would be a key way of knowing who Sanders should target in the final weeks before voting: Ignore those above 60, while focus on those below 30, because they are looking for a Clinton alternative and might be open to Sanders.

[If you want to read the audit logs](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/12/18/merged_document.pdf)

Also, to add to that, the Sanders campaign claimed a very different story:

&gt; There are a number of major discrepancies between the Sanders’ campaign narrative and what the DNC and others familiar with the matter have said.

&gt; The Sanders campaign said on Thursday night that only one of its staffers was involved in viewing the Clinton campaign’s data, but it became clear on Friday morning that multiple Sanders campaign staffers improperly accessed Clinton data.

&gt; In addition, the Sanders campaign has said that it did not download or retain any of the Clinton campaign’s data, and Weaver reiterated that claim on Friday afternoon at a press conference in Washington. “This campaign does not possess any data, does not retain any data and does not want any data,” said Weaver.

&gt; But the records from the NGP VAN software indicate that Sanders staffers did in fact save data to its own folders.

I accept what you're saying about someone with no criminal or mental history not being flagged. I don't know much anout this guy, I can't speculate what could have prevented it.

But on the issue of gun regulation in general? I'm not an expert- and in my mind the 2A guarantees individual gun ownership rights.

But when you sell your car, you're responsible for it  (tickets, e.g.), until you register the sale with the DMV. That might be one bit of effective regulation with guns. Licenses require tests and a demonstration of one's abilities, on an ongoing basis- that might be another. I imagine there are others but my knowledge on this is limited. I only recently got my gun permit, though I was a little unimpressed, since I passed the written test without studying anything and was free to walk out the door with a gun.

"&gt; Gun crime is down 69% and gun deaths are down 39% of the last 2 decades.

Yes, I think that has something to do with [fewer people owning more guns](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/03/daily-chart-12). Guns are not evenly distributed among the population. So fewer overall people own guns (the same group owns more guns than ever), so that might explain the lower rate (that and a myriad of other reasons, from better law enforcement to abortion to the lead paint ban)(edit).

Side note regarding gun crime stats; if gun violence is falling, does the argument that armed citizens are nessecary to combat crime also shrink in light of lower overall gun crime rates? I mean, is a good guy with a good nessecary when there are so few bad guys with guns? I hear we need open carry and easy concealed carry to keep from becoming a victim; are lower crime rates an argument against that idea?

&gt; Is that what you mean by looking at all the data?

Well, no my comment was quite specific to the comment about the number of gun violence incidents.

&gt; Suicides are 20k of the 30k gun deaths per year, and guns don't necessarily mean more suicides.

The chance of suicide increases dramatically when a gun is available, so that says something, considering you can kill yourself with a car or pills or razor blades and those are available in every house. Also, the survival rate of guns vs other methods is almost 0. I think the point here is that while suicide obviously still happens with our without guns, it's likely having the most successful suicide machine possible that makes them a factor in the high rates. [Check out suicide rates per gun ownership](http://www.nejm.org/action/showImage?doi=10.1056%2FNEJMp0805923&amp;iid=t01).(edit) 

And anyways, it's a death from a gun, so I think that counts as a gun death.

&gt; countries like japan, france, south korea, and 46 other countries having a higher suicide rate than the US.

"You can see the table [here](http://taxfoundation.org/article/2015-tax-brackets).

Progressive tax brackets work like this: For the first $A you make, you pay B%, then for the next $C you make, you pay D%. Each set of $ and % is called an Income Bracket.

Example:
You are single and make a taxable income (i.e. after deductions etc.) of $35,000. Look at the table referenced in the link I provided and you will see that you pay 10% on the first $9225 you make and 15% on the remaining amount (since the bracket goes all the way up to $37,450 and you only made $35,000).

Math time:
Bracket 1 taxes = 9225 * .10 = $922.50

Bracket 2 taxes = (35,000 - 9225) = 25,775 * .15 = $3,866.25

Total owed: $4,788.75 or around 13.7% of taxable income.

&gt;&gt; First of all. It is only censorship if the institution is state run. If the institution is privately run it is their right to not allow speech they disagree with. If they receive state or federal funding that should be at risk however. And I say this as someone further left than the democrats.

Listen to me, the ONLY PEOPLE that even attempt to censor free speech = liberal SJWs, it's become a serious problem recently.

They will ban anyone from debating at their school if it ""violates the safe space.""

They will protest anyone that disagrees with them (see yale.)

They will do anything they can to protect an echo chamber, this is a real issue and the fact you aren't aware of it leads me to believe you just don't even look.

"I think you're implying here that the religion of Islam is more prone to self radicalization. And you're partially right. Not that people from other religions don't self radicalize - this happens to Christians in the US, to Hindus in India, but of course the most challenging case is the case of westerners with cultural ties to Islam who either go to Syria or become Isis inspired terrorists at home.

Now it is important to figure out why this happens, so that our response can be reasoned and efficient. The most contentious and easy point to make is that this would in some manner be intrinsic to the religion. I think it is a difficult point to make. This movement of radicalization is very modern, born from a reformist interpretation of Islam developed in Saudi Arabia - known as Wahhabism or Salafism. Before the early to mid-eighties, the armed struggle in Muslim countries (in flashpoint countries such as in Afghanistan, Palestine) was very secular, and very nationalistic.

How did we go from those movements to where we are now? here is, if you want, a short and really enlightening paragraph on how the Saudi religious reformist movements morphed into the modern terrorist movements we're having to confront:

&gt; In November 1979 the government of Saudi Arabia had been forced to confront the millennial expectations raised by the calendar when a group of militants, denouncing the corruption of the Saudi regime and its ties to the US, overran the Grand Mosque in Mecca, taking thousands hostage. One of the hostage-takers declared himself to be the true Mahdi who had come to redeem Islam. The Saudi authorities, deeply shaken by this direct challenge to their rule, stormed the mosque at the cost of hundreds of lives, captured the leader of the group and within a few weeks executed him. In order to placate the ultra-conservative clerics who had fired up the militants, the Saudi royal family re-emphasised its religious conservatism. But it also took a conscious decision to export the militancy beyond its own borders in an attempt to redirect some of the anger outwards. The obvious place to transplant it was Afghanistan. Saudi money and men were siphoned into the struggle against the Soviet occupiers and the war in Afghanistan soon became a proxy for the wider conflicts being fought by and within jihadist Islam (Saudi support for Wahhabi mujahedin was matched by Iranian support for rival Shiite factions). One of those who found his way to Afghanistan was the recent Saudi college graduate Osama bin Laden, who had been looking for something to do. ([source](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n18/david-runciman/counter-counter-revolution))

How it is a false equivalence?  The argument being made is that abortion should be legal, because it doesn't affect someone not getting an abortion.

"As a liberal Democrat who is sympathetic to the idea of a single payer system, I am completely unconvinced that Clinton's comments constitute intentional distortion of the facts.

Clinton comments that we need to be mindful of the multi-trillion cost of Bernie's proposals of single payer health insurance and free college tuition. This is the statement that Common Dreams calls an intentional distortion, because Clinton doesn't mention the benefit of individuals/corporations not having to pay for health insurance. 

Huh?

It might very well be the case that the benefits outweigh the increase in taxes to the point that most people are financially better off after taxes and medical costs are adjusted for. But this is a **policy** argument, not a factual argument. Most policy decisions should be made on a net-benefits basis, and the existence of large benefits does not mean that large costs (in this cases taxes) do not exist. And given that Bernie hasn't given a complete proposal on how he would raise the additional revenue needed to fund his health care and college proposals, Clinton has every right to question where this money will come from. There are different ways of increasing taxes to get the revenue needed to pay for these things, and some could prove to be distortion to the point where the negatives from the taxation outweigh the benefits of single payer. In order to make an informed decision, we have to look at both sides of the equation.

"I'm not a libertarian. I favor keeping government about where it is in size but I would point out that 

&gt;who will stop the corporations from ruining the environment, stomping out smaller competition through dirty tricks, and generally destroying what little free market we have?

these things are all easily done by corrupting government officials. That said, I think things like the Clean Air Act show that government *can* have a moderating influence on our greed-based economy.

I tend to think there's a spectrum of problems you can choose to have (at least in the US) based on how much power you give the government over the private sector. 

* anarcho-capitalism

Quick collapse into feudalism.

* weak government

Companies control the government entirely and congress becomes a battleground between the pawns of various companies. The balance of power can be useful in some ways, but since polluting the environment is pretty much great for business that's something that would remain entirely unregulated. Collective bargaining would probably be illegal and there would be no labor laws so the gap between rich and poor would be closer to what it was 200 years ago.

* Moderate-strength government (what we have now)

A lot of corruption. The most powerful businesses attempt (and often if not usually succeed) to stifle their competition by backing regulation that ostensibly helps the average person but really just makes business into a game of who has the most money and the largest legal team. Regulation is often useful, but also often needlessly weakens the economy (in ways that favor the most powerful companies in each sector).

* strong government

Big business, while heavily regulated, is essentially regulated by the biggest players in every sector. Every company that isn't one of those biggest players has an impossible time competing with the state-favored corporations. Monopolies or at least cartels become the rule rather than the exception. The unions representing the workers for those few huge companies become monsters. Employees cannot be fired for any reason, the overhead for the monopolies increase and the quality of their products decrease--the average person spends more for worse goods. Everyone has healthcare, food, and a roof over their heads but can expect little more than that. The police are more powerful and less accountable than ever. The only limit on government intrusion into the privacy of any particular person is technology. 

* communism

We all know how this works out. 




So I tend to think that what we have is realistically the best we can hope for, as bad as it is.

"Do you only care about getting shot? Or does murder, assault, rape and robbery also make you scared? If not then the UK is you're ideal country. Half the murder, twice the rape, twice the robbery, twice the assault. And seeing how murder already naturally is far less likely than the other three categories, I'd personally be more scared to live in the UK where I'm defenseless. At least in the US I can carry a gun. Does a gun for home defense not appeal to you?

Those are very interesting examples you brought up. Two of those groups were helplessly outnumbered, whereas the gun owners of the US outnumber the military *and* police, 20:1. The gun owning US citizens are the largest armed forced in the world. What I found really interesting though was the Baltic Forrest brothers because they were a fighting force of of 50,00(and remember, there are 150+ million gun owners in the US) and they had pretty good success considering their opponents numbers.

As for whether tanks are useful, tell me how are tanks going to be of any use in urban warfare, how are they going to get supplied considering they'd be cut off from all supplies. The army wouldn't stand a chance if all US citizens stopped recognizing the authority of the US government. Hell, they'd have a hard time controlling all 300 million of us stopped recognizing their authority.

"Pretty lazy response with lack of consideration of the dynamics of humans. Many humans are constantly seeking for more, trying to achieve more and inevitably that includes money or materialism.

If you remove the liberty of profit, you will just send those that feel trapped into seeking power in the form of government jobs and ""back scratching of favors"" just so you can have that one thing that no one else can have. This is one of humanities biggest flaws and evolution is not in our favor for that changing anytime soon.

At least with money, those that want that ""one"" (or more) things can just work hard to get them instead of seeking power to manipulate others to get it. 

Just because you think, operate, and maybe even thrive with a no profit system everywhere, more than half don't and will systematically reject it.

&gt;  and then resettling the land with your own citizens 

""Resettling lands"" implies occupiers of illegally-gained lands. This would only apply if Israel lost the Six-Day War. Since they didn't, it's their land. Furthermore, if the land were illegally seized, that in and of itself does not serve as an act of genocide. Russia isn't a genocidal state simply because it annexed Crimea. Nor is it an occupier state, instead it's a state that happens to occupy. But this doesn't apply to Israel because the land was legally obtained in the first place. 

Even the Palestinians (really trans-Jordanians) had the land, it was illegal under the Ottoman Empire to have land rights (everything belonged to the Sultan). [When the land was legally transferred over to the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres) (as a result of losing the 1st world war for siding with the Germans), it became legally British Land. [After Britain parcelled it out for the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine), it became Jewish Land. Britain didn't forget the Palestinians though, and gave them [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Transjordan) and Egypt. 

To deny Israel independence simply because it was gifted land legally by the British Empire is to deny the independence of [53 formerly commonwealth nations stemming from the Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom).

"&gt;I don't see a Trump presidency as any worse than more of the status quo, and I think I can survive the cliff jump.

And your concern for those who can't? Does it even exist? And if you don't see a man who's openly advocated outright, institutionalised racism and persecution as worse, then I maintain my position that you're simply past the point of thinking straight here. This is the argument of emotion, not reason.

&gt;If you can't, vote for whoever you want.

That's not up for discussion, both of us are free to vote however we choose. I'm not trying to force your hand, but you chose to engage in discussion and that's what this is.

&gt;What planet do you live on? Like Obama hasn't already mobilized conservative voters to turn out and vote for Trump. Four more years of listening to them bitch about Benghazi and call for her impeachment.

The planet on which Obama's presidency has already pushed the GOP down a more and more self destructive path, which Trump has accelerated. If even Trump loses then there is no longer *any* viable game plan within the current Republican base, and a full self reinvention seems more likely to me. I'd rather they self destructed out of power, rather than simply realigned their gameplan in line with what he's shown works, whilst actually having power.

&gt;If you cared about my voting actions, you'd be crediting me for voting for the lesser of two evils for the last 20 years

I'm not here to pat you on the back. We're discussing what should be done now, and I disagree with your reasoning, so that's what I'm voicing. I do agree in principle with this approach, but you're reading too much in to me not saying something in a discussion where what's going on now is objectively the most important point for discussion.

&gt;voting in off year elections, voting for local elections, wisely, responsibly, and LOOK WHERE ALL THAT GOT US.

And this is the core point once again. ""Trying something different"" *is an abdication from actually justifying that alternative as better, not just different.* Something being different is not in and of itself a good thing.

&gt;I'm pretty sure they aren't thinking about my welfare when they decide to vote.

So you want to be talked to like a 4 year old who's standing there shouting ""he started it"" after bloodying someone's nose? You don't know how these people voted, and *you yourself* seem to be asking for sympathy based on trying and not seeing it work? How many other people in exactly the same position will you be hurting (or contributing to the hurt of) by this action?

Sorry, but this has only compounded my point. Your argument is one of acting out, of despair, not of reason. And whilst that's an understandable position to reach after having ""the lesser of two evils"" still turn out shitty, what did you expect? We're talking about two evils. So your answer is now just to start picking the worse one, still without any true explanation of how it'll help.",,,,ThePegasi,,,1449853400,t5_2cneq,t3_3wa38i,t1_cxvgn40,0,1451582194,0,0,cxvhhy6,politics,0,,

"The reality is 99% of Republicans who talk about wanting to shrink government and cut spending are disingenuous and not serious about it. Ron Paul was I think pretty clearly serious about it (one reason the establishment would never allow him to be President). I think his son is too.

As Ron Paul's 2012 campaign spokeman, Doug Wead, said, ""If Ron Paul Got The Ring of Power, He'd Throw﻿ It In Mount Doom!""
